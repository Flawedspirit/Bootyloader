# Bootloader
 A random project to refresh my assembly knowledge

 This project has no purpose. I just like learning about "black box" technology, and for most people, the bootloader that starts their OS is as black box as it gets.

 As of right now it only runs in a QEMU x86-64 emulator, but I'm working to figure out how to get it to run on bare metal.
